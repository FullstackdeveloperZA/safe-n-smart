Young gay men and other MSM, especially those in Africa, have a 24 times higher risk of contracting HIV than the general population. They are faced with a lack of evidence-based information, lots of misinformation, limited resources and stigma and discrimination when it comes to accessing advice and information regarding their sex lives.</v-flex>
<v-flex ma-3>Safe n Smart is a progressive web application (PWA) that is, in short, a safe sex guide for young gay guys and men who have sex with men. Our goal is to reach and engage young men who have sex with men and to provide them with non-judgemental, accurate information and advice. Safe n Smart focus on edutainment through using social behaviour change communication techniques. Topics addressed include, but are not limited to, sexuality, sexual health, HIV/STI prevention, mental health, stigma and discrimination (including internalised stigma) and substance use.</v-flex>
