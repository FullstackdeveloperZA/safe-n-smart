            answerText: `This is a good question, one that deserves a detailed answer. Male-to-male anal sex involves three things: fingering, rimming, and fucking. Before engaging in any of those three, it’s a good idea to be sure your bowel doesn’t need emptying. In other words, if you feel like having a shit, delay the anal sex until you have had your shit. Don’t wipe your arse so determinedly with sometimes coarse toilet paper that you do damage to the sensitive skin around the anus. Rather keep wet wipes handy and use those.`,

         answerText: `Oh, okay, undeveloped, now that you’ve given me some measurements, I can absolutely assure you that you’ve got nothing to worry about at all. No need to go anywhere near the doc. If your cock leaps from 5cm limp to 18cm erect, then you’re out there with the big boys. Gay men aren’t too concerned with limp dicks; what they’re into are erect dicks. Be happy with 5cm. Remember, the long limp dicks are pretty much the same length when erect; with you, there’s clearly an impressive “wow” difference.`,

Don’t deliberately get pre-cum in your mouth, but don’t panic if you do. Even if he cums in your mouth, just get rid of the cum by spitting it out or swallowing it (the stomach acids will kill off the virus). All of this sounds very ‘clinical' and distinctly unromantic.

                questionText: `Can someone contract HIV through mutual masturbation & is it possible to contract anything when you come in contact with someone's cum?`,
                answerText: `To do any infecting, his cum has to get inside your blood-system, or your cum has to get inside his blood-system. If you are jerking one another off, there’s very little likelihood of that happening, as long as neither cock goes into the other person’s mouth or arse - in which case you’re no longer wanking.

                So, there are only two other possibilities:
                One is if he cums on your skin and you’ve got an open cut or sore.Then the cum can get inside the cut or sore and into the blood. So, if either of you has a cut or sore somewhere on your skin where the other guy's cum could reach, just stick an Elastoplast or Band-Aid over it, and then the cum can't get in. That's being super-careful!
                The other possibility is this: Don’t get cum in your eye; that’s a very easy route to your blood-system. If you do, wash your eye out immediately with cold water and do so several times until there can't be any trace of it left.
                If you want him to cum over your face (some people really like that), just keep your eyes closed. 
                There's nothing in cum that can penetrate unbroken skin, so you can't catch anything by touching cum or having cum on your skin. Also, the HI virus dies when it's outside the body; it doesn't survive in air. 
                Nonetheless, if you've touched his cum or smeared it over him or yourself, don't then immediately put your fingers in your mouth or your arse, though the risk of anything being transmitted is minimal. 
                Basically, jerking one another off is a 99.9% no-risk activity, and a very pleasant one! `,

                answerText: `Very confusing, I know. The thing is: He who does the penetrating, he who puts his cock into someone else's orifice, whether it is anus or mouth, is the active one, the 'top', even if he's physically on the bottom.

                What does it matter? 
                What does it mean to 'be a top' or to 'be a bottom' or to 'be versatile'? 
                It’s just a matter of what you enjoy one role or the other or both. 
                
                I’ve known someone whose self-image was damaged because, he said, the guys were calling him 'unmanly' because he was 'the woman', when really he just liked being the bottom. It's camp nonsense. Not worth worrying about. You do what you like doing. 
                To move on to the Spit-or-Swallow debate. The first thing that's assumed is that the cock in your mouth does not have a condom on it. If it does, the issue doesn't arise (unless you're into biting, which is clearly going to be risky behaviour all round). It's best not to get pre-cum or cum in your mouth. If you do, it's not the end of the world. Either spit it out, and perhaps rinse your mouth out with cold water. Or swallow it (so long as you know your throat is healthy, with no sores or other infections). Risks are slight, either way. Your saliva contains enzymes that are used to fighting off 'foreign invasions' coming into your mouth, so that will kill off any of the virus that may stay in your mouth. The same applies to the stomach acids: they will kill off the virus. So, assuming a healthy mouth and throat, there seems little chance of the virus in the other guy's cum

                All sexually active gay and bisexual men should be tested regularly for STDs. The only way to know your STD status is to get tested (you can search for a testing site).

                Chlamydia and gonorrhea of the penis (urethra) if you have had insertive anal sex (been on the “top”) or received oral sex in the past year; and
                Gonorrhea of the throat if you’ve given oral sex (your mouth on your partner’s penis, vagina, or anus) in the past year.

However, I’m going to answer by focusing on whether vibrator and sex toy use is “common” among men instead of focusing on whether it’s “normal.” My reason for saying this is because I don’t want to turn this into a discussion about whether you should or shouldn’t be using sex toys. In my view, that’s something that you and (if applicable) your partner should decide for yourselves based on what you’re comfortable with. After all, you can have a great sex life with or without the addition of toys.
                That said, there’s not a lot of research on men’s sex toy use. I suspect that part of the reason for this is because vibrators and other sex toys have traditionally been viewed as things that exist more for female pleasure than for male pleasure.

In fact, although almost half of the men in the U.S. survey mentioned above reported having used a vibrator before, only 16.6% said that they had used one alone during masturbation. In light of this finding, it is perhaps not surprising that when men were asked why they first began incorporating vibrators into their sex lives, some of the most common reasons included wanting to please one’s partner, to help one’s partner have an orgasm, or to “spice up” one’s sex life.`,

                answerText: `Daily PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by more than 90%. Among people who inject drugs, it reduces the risk by more than 70%. Your risk of getting HIV from sex can be even lower if you combine PrEP with condoms and other prevention methods.`,

                answerText: `PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is only for people who are at ongoing very high risk of HIV infection. But PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is an option for someone who thinks they’ve recently been exposed to HIV during sex or through sharing needles and works to prepare drugs.
                PEP means taking antiretroviral medicines after a potential exposure to HIV to prevent becoming infected. PEP must be started within 72 hours of possible exposure to HIV. If you’re prescribed PEP, you’ll need to take it once or twice daily for 28 days`,

                questionText: `Does this mean I can stop using condoms?`,
                answerText: `Whether or not you use condoms is a personal choice. Or hopefully this is a mutual choice with your partner. Condoms are effective at stopping many STIs.

                But if HIV is the only concern, then in the context of U=U, there is no reason to continue to use condoms.
                
                In the context of U=U, condoms don’t have any further impact on reducing the risk of HIV transmission.
                
                For people who are happy using condoms for other reasons, this will still be an important choice.`,
