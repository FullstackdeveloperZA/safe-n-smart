      caption: `I am a dynamic occupational therapist and challenge myself to deliver the highest standard 
      of work. Since 2008, I have been involved in the medico-legal industry and developed a keen interest and desire to 
      further myself and my 
      skills within the field. I have worked shoulder to shoulder with many trend-setters and passionate therapist who paved 
      the way for me to continue in this field.<br/>
      I have consulted and assessed clients since 2008 with various conditions, i.e. orthopaedic injuries, head injuries, 
      etc. for both adult and paediatric clients.  I have also been involved in assessing and treating children with various 
      conditions, i.e. developmental delays and learning difficulties for several years. I have assisted in presenting 
      stimulation programmes at a local school focused at improving gross motor skills, fine motor skills and visual perception 
      for foundation learners.<br/>
      I am part of a fast-growing and globally recognised NGO, Gateway Health Institute, who specialized in youth empowerment 
      programmes, improving health in poor communities, and developing technology to facilitate health awareness and prevention 
      programmes. As part of this team, I will do research, in collaboration with GHI, to identify the impact of Life Skills 
      training through sports and the quality of life on the youth in rural communities.
